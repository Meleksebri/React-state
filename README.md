In this react project , the Profile component contains the field that shows the time interval since the last component was mounted using the component lifecycle. Then,
I transform the App.js into a class-based component.
And in the App component , I implemented a state for this class (App component) containing a Person ={ fullName,bio, imgSrc, profession} and a boolean shows and
added a button that toggles the show state. When the show state is true, the person's profile will appear.
